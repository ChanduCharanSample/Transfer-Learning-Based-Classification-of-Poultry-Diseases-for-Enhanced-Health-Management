# Transfer-Learning-Based-Classification-of-Poultry-Diseases-for-Enhanced-Health-Management
This project uses **Transfer Learning (VGG16)** to classify poultry diseases based on image data. It categorizes poultry into four classes:
- **Salmonella**
- **New Castle Disease**
- **Coccidiosis**
- **Healthy**

A **Flask-based web application** is developed to allow farmers, students, and commercial poultry businesses to upload images and receive real-time disease predictions to support early intervention and health management.

##  Model Details

- **Architecture**: VGG16 (pre-trained)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Training Data**: Poultry disease dataset (Kaggle)
- **Preprocessing**: Image resizing, augmentation
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, loss, confusion matrix
